For every player currently in the league see if clutch data
is statistically different from normal data, get different intervals.

Look at players with highest total clutch, and players with highest difference 
(good and bad)

IMAGES = Top 10 clutch for each of pts, assists, rebounds, TS%

Model all players pts, assists, rebounds, TS% and then model
all players pts, assists, rebounds, TS% 

TS% calculate by getting TSA = FGA + 0.44*FTA
then PTS/ 2*TSA

DISTRIBUTION OF PTS, AST, REB, BLK, STL, TS%

aggregates = grouped.agg({'MIN':'sum','GP':'sum', 'W':'sum', 'L':'sum', 'PTS':'mean',
                         'REB':'mean', 'AST':'mean','BLK':'mean','STL':'mean','FGM':'mean',
                         'FGA': 'mean', 'FTA':'mean', 'PLUS_MINUS':'mean', 'TSA':'mean'})

EXTRA: Analyze narratives (westbrook vs nets, lillard clutchness)

averaging over a bigger sample

look at specific players over the clutch time

hypothesis testing

power analysis

average of averages


hypothesis testing - normalize data or not?

regular vs playoffs
